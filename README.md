# aws-rotate-iam-keys
Rotate your IAM Keys to be in compliance with security best practices. AWS talks about rotating your keys every 30, 45, or 90 days. But who has the time to make their own script and remember to do that? I did. And security is easier when its less than 3 lines that you need to copy + paste to be secure. Now it's easy to rotate your IAM credentials nightly and wake up with more security than the day before.

## Installation
AWS Rotate IAM Keys is supported by all major platforms.

### Ubuntu

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rhyeal/aws-rotate-iam-keys
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install aws-rotate-iam-keys
```

### MacOS

```
brew tap SMARTeacher/aws-rotate-iam-keys https://github.com/SMARTeacher/aws-rotate-iam-keys
brew install aws-rotate-iam-keys
```
Requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install. I am hoping to be included in Homebrew Core soon!

***IMPORTANT:*** You must install your own cron job for automated key rotation. [Instructions here](https://github.com/rhyeal/aws-rotate-iam-keys#macos-1) or scroll down to `Additional Cron Instructions` below.

### Other Linux

```
wget -q https://github.com/rhyeal/aws-rotate-iam-keys/blob/master/aws-rotate-iam-keys_0.8.1.deb -o aws-rotate-iam-keys.deb
sudo dpkg -i aws-rotate-iam-keys.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
rm aws-rotate-iam-keys.deb # optional file clean up
```

### Windows

[Click here](https://aws-rotate-iam-keys.com/aws-rotate-iam-keys.ps1) to download the executable PowerShell script.

Simply place this in any directory and then run it. It will install the Scheduled Task to rotate your keys nightly upon first run and will rotate your keys on each run thereafter.

## Features

AWS Rotate IAM Keys is simple and powerful. There aren't too many features other than rotating keys for a single profile or multiple profiles. The power comes from multiple cron jobs daily that can rotate multiple sets of keys automatically.

### Improvements / Issues

* Currently, AWS Rotate IAM Keys will only work with a single computer. Rotating keys on a desktop and a laptop for the same IAM user will lead to invalid keys.
* AWS Rotate IAM Keys takes an opinionated view that you should only have 1 active key at a time. It might not work with IAM users that have 2 keys active at a time.

## Documentation

#### To rotate your default profile manually:

```
$ aws-rotate-iam-keys
Making new access key
Updating profile: default
Made new key AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
Key rotated
```

#### To rotate a specific profile in your `~/.aws/credentials` file:

```
$ aws-rotate-iam-keys --profile myProfile
$ aws-rotate-iam-keys -p myProfile
```

#### To rotate multiple profiles *with the same key*:

```
$ aws-rotate-iam-keys --profiles myProfile,myOtherProfile
```

The result of the above script is that both `myProfile` and `myOtherProfile` will have the **same access and secret keys** in your `~/.aws/credentials` file.

#### To rotate multiple profiles *with their own keys*:

```
$ aws-rotate-iam-keys --profile myProfile
$ aws-rotate-iam-keys --profile myOtherProfile
```

The result of the above script is that `myProfile` and `myOtherProfile` will have **different** access and secret keys in your `~/.aws/credentials` file.

## Additional Cron Instructions
For some operating systems, you need to install your own cron schedule. This is
due to the fact that some operating systems do not allow installed programs
via the package managers selected to create their own cron schedules.

### MacOS

MacOS does not allow programs to modify the crontab when installing via Homebrew. Unfortunately, this means that MacOS users will need to manually finish installation to automate AWS Rotate IAM Keys. Here's how to do that:

#### Using a cron job (easiest)

Open your crontab by typing:

```
EDITOR=nano crontab -e
```

Copy and paste the following line into the end of the crontab file:

```
33 4 * * * /usr/local/bin/aws-rotate-iam-keys --profile default >/dev/null 2>&1 #rotate AWS keys daily
```

Save your crontab with `Ctrl` + `O` and then press `[Enter]`. Exit and apply changes with `Ctrl` + `X`. That's it!

#### Using launchd (MacOS recommended)

[Launchd](http://www.launchd.info/) is the MacOS replacement for cron.

Open a Terminal and cd into the Launch Agents directory. Make the plist file and open your text editor.

```
cd ~/Library/LaunchAgents
touch com.aws.rotate.iam.keys.plist
nano com.aws.rotate.iam.keys.plist
```

Copy and paste the following into your text editor:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
	<dict>
		<key>PATH</key>
		<string>/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin</string>
	</dict>
	<key>Label</key>
	<string>com.aws.rotate.iam.keys</string>
	<key>ProgramArguments</key>
	<array>
		<string>/usr/local/bin/aws-rotate-iam-keys</string>
		<string>--profile</string>
		<string>default</string>
	</array>
	<key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
	<dict>
		<key>Hour</key>
		<integer>3</integer>
		<key>Minute</key>
		<integer>23</integer>
	</dict>
</dict>
</plist>

```

Save the file with `Ctrl` + `O` and then press `[Enter]`. Exit with `Ctrl` + `X`.

Load up the launchd job with
```
launchctl load -F ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.aws.rotate.iam.keys.plist
```

You can check that everything worked by running:
```
launchctl start com.aws.rotate.iam.keys
```

That's it. Now your keys will be rotated every day for you.

### Windows

AWS Rotate IAM Keys is set up to automatically schedule a task for you upon first run. If you want to edit the profiles that are being updated, you need to modify the task using [Task Scheduler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/taskschd/task-scheduler-start-page). Look for a task named "AWS Rotate IAM Keys" and modify the `-profile` parameter from `default` to a comma-separated list of your profile names.

If you move the .ps1 script from the initial location where you first ran it, you will need to modify the path in the task to point to the correct script location.
